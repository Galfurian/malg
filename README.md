# Matrix ALGebra library (MALG)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Galfurian/CPPTracer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Galfurian/CPPTracer)

Malg is a collection of classes and functions to perform vector/matrix algebra
operations. It also contains a series of **control**-realted structure and
functions. For instance, continuous- or discrete-time state space models,
discretization function, ackerman formula, and others.

## Structure
 - include  : Application headers.
 - tests    : Sources for testing.
 - examples : Sources for examples.
